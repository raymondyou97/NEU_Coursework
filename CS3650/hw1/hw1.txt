                             HOMEWORK 1
		   	due date: Tues., Jan. 16 (by end of day)

For homework 1, you must write a simple program in assembly.
The program is the C program:  hw1-factorial.c
in the course directory.
You can test the C program via:  gcc hw1-factorial.c ; ./a.out

Your program must print a prompt, read an integer, and then write the
answer, as is done in hw1-factorial.c .  Just as in hw1-factorial.c,
your assembly program must use a recursive style.
Page A-44 of the text shows how to use system calls.  The system calls
that you need are:  print_str, read_int, print_int, and exit

Note also that hw1-example* gives you a simple C program, along with
two translations to Assembly.  (The first translation is short, but
also takes some shortcuts.  The second version is closer to what
you need for your homework.)
[ hw1-example* should appear soon. ]

In addition, you should include next to each line of the C source code as
a comment just before the corresponding assembly code.
For example:
 add $t4, $t2, $t1 # x = y + z
While comments are not strictly required, if your code is not clear or
doesn't work, and if the grader cannot figure out why, then the grader
can assume the worst in determining the grade.


You must submit an on-line copy of your assembly source.
To submit on-line, login to the UNIX system and do:
    /course/cs3650/homework/submit-cs3650-hw1  hw1.s
(assuming that this contains your assembly program, hw1.s;
 hw1.asm is another popular filetype)

The online version is due by the end of the due date (by midnight,
or a few hours after midnight).

======================================================================
See the course home page for the Mars MIPS simulator.

Note that page A-44 of Appendix A has a table of "system services"
(system calls).  These allow you to do I/O.

Further, the Mars simulator requires you to terminate your program
by calling the "exit" system call.  It produces an error if your
main() routine simply returns.  The text describes the Mars simulator
under the older SPIM name (Appendix A.9).
