			    Homework 9
		    DUE DATE:  Friday, Apr. 13

The goal of this homework is to check correctness of various implementations
of condition variables that use semaphores and mutexes.
To do this, you will build a model of each implementation in PlusCal.
(The idea of checking a model is the basis for PlusCal.  This is known as:
 "explicit state model checking".)

As usual, you should create a tarball.  You will not need a Makefile
this time.  The grader will read your files directly.

The details of the assignment are found in the subdirectory:
  cond-var-implementations

You must first download TLA+ from:
  https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html#downloading
Note that you can run TLA+ on any of the three major platforms:
  Windows, Mac OS, Linux
Be sure to chooze the correct zip file for your chosen platform
when you download.

The TLA+ (PlusCal) package has a rather steep learning curve.  Please study:
  /course/cs3650/tla+/000-README
and
  /course/cs3650/tla+/notes-on-using-tla+.txt
and the examples in
  /course/cs3650/tla+/PlusCal-examples/

[ If you are looking at this from the web, you will need to look at:
    https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3650/parent/tla+/ ]

Unfortunately, TLA+ has some mis-features.  Please be sure to read
all of the information in "notes-on-using-tla+.txt".  This will save
you a lot of time in figuring out how to use TLA+.
