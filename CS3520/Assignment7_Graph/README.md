# Graphs

We covered the basics of the binary search tree in the video lectures [part 1]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cnPTxBzPH0),
[part 2]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2QMfUQoZl8).

In this assignment we have provided you nearly complete code that you need to finish. All testing and complete graph code
has been given to you. Make sure you read and understand the code and also watch the videos that go over the code.
All code has been written in a single header file, this way it is easier for you to compile and run the code.

# TODO (DONE):

Make sure you implement the following functions:

```cpp
//TODO: Returns true if dst node can be reached from src node;
bool isReachalbe(MyGraph & g, int src, int dst){
    return false;
}


//TODO: Returns true if the graph has a cycle, false otherwise.
bool hasCycle(MyGraph & g){
    return false;
}

//TODO: Returns the shortest path between src and dst as a vector of nodes that need to be visited.
std::vector<int> shortestPath(MyGraph & g, int src, int dst){
    std::vector<int> nodes;
    return nodes;
}
```


# Grading

We have provided you with a test file so you don't have to write one. Each section of test cases has been assgined
a number of points. Each test you pass you get the assigned points. We will still look at your code and change the expected
output but you can use these tests as a guideline for your grade on this assignment.

Please let us know if you have any questions. This is a bonus assigment. It is due Tuesday at Midnight April 14th.
