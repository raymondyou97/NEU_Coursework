# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.


# Stack and Queue as a classes (Your TO DO)

In Assignment 2 you implemented a simple queue and a stack using structs. Similarly to Lab 4, convert your implementations to
use classes.

### Unit Tests

Adapt your unit tests to work with your new implementation. 

# Rubric

- 100% Correct Stack and Queue implementation with classes
  - All functions should be implemented. Do not rename the functions, but you may add any 'helper' functions if you deem necessary.
    - (e.g. You might have a 'double_linked_list_print' to help you debug)
  - There should be no memory leaks
  - There should be no bugs in your functions 
  - Your implementation will be graded by our set of unit tests, and we will check your code 'style' as well.
