This directory contains an implementation of the While and
While/Fork languages.

Files:

    whileFork.txt   syntax of the While/Fork language
    whileFork.pg    LL(1) grammar for the While/Fork language
    tokens.scm      regular expressions for tokens of While/Fork

    dfa.scm         the DFA generated from tokens.scm
    parser.scm      the LL(1) parser generated from whileFork.pg
    lexer.scm       lexical analyzer for WhileFork (uses dfa.scm)
    actions.scm     action routines called by the parser
    ast.scm         abstract syntax trees as an abstract data type
    interp.scm      interpreter of While/Fork abstract syntax trees
    whileFork.sps   interpreter of While/Fork programs
    whileFork       executable shell that calls whileFork.sps

    test1.wf        accepts prime numbers
    test2.wf        accepts composite numbers greater than 2
    test3.wf        accepts ASCII palindromes of even length
    test4.wf        accepts ASCII palindromes of even length

The test2.wf and test3.wf programs use a fork statement.
The test1.wf and test4.wf programs do not use fork statements.
